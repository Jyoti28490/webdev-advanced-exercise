# Exercise for Web Developers #

## Ajax Search ##

Welcome to our programming exercise for Web Developers. 

Please provide a basic search functionality for the test keyword “Statista” using our Statista search API data.

For more details, please see below.

---

### Frame conditions ###

* Instead of the real API use this JSON file with Statista search data for the AJAX request:
https://cdn.statcdn.com/static/application/search_results.json
* This sample data only contains search results for the keyword “Statista”. This means the search functionality does not work for other search terms, which is fine.
* The provided code contains a basic Vue.js app, feel free to rewrite or extend it. You may also use any other reactive framework.

### Goal ###

* List the search results, at least including title and description.
* Show the number of results for the keyword (in this case “Statista”).
* Keep usability and accessibility in mind. Code for real world conditions.
* Think about possible obstacles and do not hesitate to reach out and ask additional questions.
* If there is time left think about additional features that would be interesting for a user.

### Support ###

* You can use statista.com as a design reference. The basic style sheets are already linked in the provided code.
* API documentation:
  * https://de.statista.com/api
